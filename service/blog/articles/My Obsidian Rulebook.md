In the last several years, I have been struggling. I meet too much information
and constantly worry about missing something important; I want to do something I
have done before, but I forget how I achieved that, so I must search and study
again; I have a lot of ideas in my mind, but little of these will be done in
practice. Too many thoughts flood my mind, making me feel pressure and anxiety.

Someday, I heard that many people benefit from a personal note-taking system. I
found one of the most famous books in this domain,
[_Building a Second Brain_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain)
and its extension,
[_The PARA Method_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134634583-the-para-method),
written by Tiago Forte. After reading, I built a note-taking system following
these two books in Obsidian.

After about one month of practice, I wrote this rulebook to myself. This is my
thinking and practice in note-taking, not a reading note from these books, and
not wanting to rule someone else. But if this can inspire you, I'll be thrilled.

This article follows the order from most important to least: the principles,
methods, and implements.

## The principles

In short, to **make me take action and get things done**.

There are libraries, search engines, and AIs in this modern world. If a
note-taking system is made to store and organize knowledge, it has little
advanced meaning for me. The most helpful way to take notes should revolve
around my aims and actions.

Following this principle, this system captures, organizes, and provides the
materials and thoughts around my actions, purpose, responsibility, and
interests. Don't spend too much time making the system perfect for organizing,
tagging, and linking notes.

There are many metaphors for note-taking systems. For me, it's a studio with a
workbench: Capture things needed for the studio's warehouse. When I start work,
I put everything I need on the workbench; it makes me focus on work. After I
worked, I archived things, cleaned the workbench, and prepared for the next.

### The methods

Follow the **CODE** method in _Building a Second Brain_. Write all notes in my
own words.

- **C**apture all things that resonate. If I can not ensure the folder to place
  notes immediately, or I'm not reading, put it in the inbox.
- **O**rganize notes according to the PARA structure(described later).
- **D**istill its essence when each time a note is touched. Bolding,
  highlighting, summarizing, rewriting. But keep the original source if
  possible.
- **E**xpress from notes. Put notes to practice.

I must write and distill all notes in my own words to force myself to think and
remember. This will create a shortcut and hook in my brain, speeding up the
thought in the future.

Express is the step to make notes valuable. Express is not the end; I should
actively seek feedback and take what I learn to note to help future projects.

### Organize notes

Use the **PARA** method to organize notes into four folders:

- **P**rojects: Short-term, end-able, goal-defined projects.
- **A**reas: Long-term responsibility. I especially named sub-areas "domains."
- **R**esources: Topics or interests may be valuable for the future.
- **A**rchives: Inactive items for now. Completed project, inactive responsibility.

Don't consider putting a note in a perfect, persistent place; **make the notes
flow**:

- When the system starts, archive all existing notes to a "archive-<date>"
  folder in **Archives**.
- When a new project, area, or resource begins, create a folder in **Projects**,
  **Areas**, or **Resources** and add or link all needed notes.
- When a project, area, or resource is completed, canceled, or inactive,
  reorganize helpful notes to **Projects**, **Areas**, or **Resources** and
  archive the remaining notes.
- If a project is too complex, divide it into several projects and reorganize
  the parts that can't be executed now.
- If new executable work is incubated from **Areas** and **Resources**, create
  a new project and move or link needed notes.
- If notes become helpful again, move out from the **Archives**.

### Maintain

Notes usually change over time, but periodic maintenance is still necessary.
According to the principle, don't take too much time.

- **Daily**: clear the inbox (in all apps), move notes to Projects, Areas, or
  Resources, or delete them. Write today's journals.
- **Weekly**: Review all projects. Check the completed and creatable.
- **Monthly**: Review all Areas and Resources. Check the ended and creatable.

### The Implement

I implemented the system mainly in Obsidian, but doing everything in Obsidian is
impossible. I use the same method in other platforms and applications, such as
cloud drivers and web clippers.

Obsidian has many functions: folders, tags, and links. Since notes are
frequently moved using the PARA method, I finally implemented my note-taking
system using folders. By the way, I was relaxed while traveling through the file
tree.

Practically, I made these folders in Obsidian:

```
.
├── 1 Projects/
├── 2 Areas/
├── 3 Resources/
├── 4 Archives/
├── assets/
├── journals/
└── stage/
```

I put a number prefix to make the PARA folders in order. And there are three
secondary folders: "journals" for daily journals, assets for attachments and
files, and "stage" for inbox.

That's all! I have been running this system for about one month. After the
initial friction and bumps in the road, I'm currently happy with it. I'm feeling
less stress and anxiety and getting more done.
